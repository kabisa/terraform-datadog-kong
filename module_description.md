This module can be used to monitor the Kong system, modules have been build based on advice we've got from Kong.
Not in scope (yet?) are monitors for the applications hosted behind Kong.
It also has the option to monitor the docker containers with the embedded [docker module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/kabisa/docker-container/datadog/latest)
